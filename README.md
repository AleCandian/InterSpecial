## Motivation
As societal, industrial, and scientific issues are getting more extensive and complex, the demand for experts with interdisciplinary skills is increasing.
It is the diversity of in-depth perspectives that is necessary to tackle the newest scientific frontiers and the major societal
challenges we face today. This combination of diversity and depth is characteristic of the world-leading interdisciplinary research at the UvA, such as Origins research that is conducted within the Faculty of Science, and provides opportunities for educational innovation.
