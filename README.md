# InterSpecial

## Motivation
As societal, industrial, and scientific issues are getting more extensive and complex, the demand for experts with interdisciplinary skills is increasing.
It is the diversity of in-depth perspectives that is necessary to tackle the newest scientific frontiers and the major societal
challenges we face today. This combination of diversity and depth is characteristic of the world-leading interdisciplinary research at the University of Amsterdam, such as the Origin of life, that provides opportunities for educational innovation tighly link to research.
At the same time,universities are confronted with unprecedented high teaching- and workload for academic staff and a new generation of students who are in need of - now often extracurricular - skills and experience and have a wish to stand out.

## The initiative
_InterSpecial_ is an innovative, out-of-the-box educational initiative that will train students at the different institutes of the Faculty of Science to work effectively as expert specialists in different disciplines (e.g. chemistry, physics, computer science, astronomy) within interdisciplinary teams. The pilot of this initiative will involve around the research theme Origin of Life, but it will be generalised to other interdisciplinary research themes.

_InterSpecial_ will be offered to advanced students,from existing programs who want to obtain interdisciplinary research
skills without losing their specialized focus. The goal of InterSpecials is threefold:
1. Let these students develop skills to work as a specialist in interdisciplinary teams on a complex issue 
2. reduce the teaching load across the Faculty of Science while improving its quality and reach
3. foster the connections between teaching and research.

## Collaboration
_InterSpecial_ is an initiative that will encompass the Faculty of Science of the University of Amsterdam. This involves in particular the Institute for Interdisciplinary Studies (IIS), The Anton Pannekoek Institute for Astronomy (API) and the van 't Hoff Institute for Molecular Sciences (HIMS).
